# Download
Download the executable .exe with the folder _internals because it contains Tkinter dependencies. I will made a .msi installer to made easier the downloading in following versions. You can also download it on the webpage <a href="index.html">index.html</a>, but it's I tkink better and easier to use the first methode. I want to publish the website later, because I don't want to pay it now.
