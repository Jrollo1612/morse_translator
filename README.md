## Version 1.0

<a href="/traducteur_morse_2/">Version 1.0</a><br>
Initial version of the translator.

## Version 1.1

<a href="/Traducteur_Morse-v.1.1/">Version 1.1</a><br>
Second version of the translator. I fix a problem that appear when we put a space on the morse code that we write on the interface. Now, the space is represented as "//".

## Version 1.2

[Version 1.2](/TraducteurMorsev12)<br>
Third version of the translator. Now, I made an installer. I add an auto-translate function. I change the morse characters by emoji, and I add a bar to type faster.

# Download

Download the executable .exe with the folder \_internals because it contains Tkinter dependencies on the versions under 1.2. I will made an installer to made easier the downloading in following versions. You can also download it on the webpage <a href="index.html">index.html</a>, but it's I think better and easier to use the first methode. I want to publish the website later, because I don't want to pay domain now.
